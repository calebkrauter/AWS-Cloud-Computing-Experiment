# AWS-Cloud-Computing-Experiment

**Project Description**

This project uses a Transform Load Query (TLQ) pipeline on a sample data set. It performs the roughly the same algorithm for each step in each of the languages used. Each step makes use of cloud resources to achieve functionality. Each step is also measured in several ways to learn about the variablity in cloud computing.
