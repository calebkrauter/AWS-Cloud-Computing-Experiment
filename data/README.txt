Sample data files should go under this folder (data).
This file (data/README.txt) should be deleted once sample data files are added in.
CSVs that the project creates in the transform step should be stored in here.
The new CSVs should have meaningful names that inform what data size they were made from and which language they were made in.
Example names: ts100.csv, java1000.csv, java10000.csv
